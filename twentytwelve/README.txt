Heavily modified twentytwelve theme made originally for the GO-thess 
tourism website for the town of Thessaloniki Greece in 2013

WARNING!!! the theming was a quick and dirty job to make it work with the specific plugins and the images put in place 
It's by no means a standalone theme and has some !important declaration or display:none
It's only purpose here is mainly as a reference to have ready code snippets for future projects
(and as easy way to prove that I was indeed the one who made the website(although I'm not sure if I should be proud))

Otherwise it's a fluid theme which you can see on the original website.
