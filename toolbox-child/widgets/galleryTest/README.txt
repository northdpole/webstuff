ATTENTION!

The generator script assumes that the contents of the caption_info.txt file are as follows:
"filename" => "image caption" => "info text" => "read more hyperlink";

It literally parses for ";" and "=>" so dont ever forget it
Also note: An entry starts at a newline and ends with a ";" followed by a "\n" (civilized world newline symbol)
Also a comment start on a newline with a #
empty lines are ignored
